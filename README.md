# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###
This repository contains my solution for some common algorithms. I've created this repository to learn about algorithms and improve solving different common computer science problems.
Each solved problem has a program written in Java.
Every solution is tested and some problems contains more than one solution with different implementations.
version = '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

### How do I get set up? ###

In this project you can open a project that has Gradle and SBT build configuration scripts respectively.
You can use any of these two to build the algorithm project by choosing the proper option in Intellij IDE.

During cloning the repository you can specify the location of your folder you want for the project in your local machine.
Then Open your project with Intellij and build it.

Inside the project structure, in src->main->java you will find the Java implementation of all the problems stored. 

After compiling the project,  you can check the solution executing tests inside tests directory.

 You can use various Java Monitoring tools for diagnosing the problems with virtual machines and the applications.
 I have consolidated all the information that I retrieved by using Java Monitoring tools in the "Java Monitoring Tool doc OOLE"
 document inside the folder which you can refer for better understanding.
